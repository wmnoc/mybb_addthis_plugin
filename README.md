Friends,
Would you like more visitors from social media?

Plugin Installation
Copy "addthis.php" to plugins directory.
Activate the Plugin from ACP

Configuration
MyBB AddThis Plugin requires a "Profile ID" Go to AddThis.com, signup and create a profile and copy the profile ID.
Profile ID would be something like this: 'ra-99e3404b22a33456'.

After profile creation, Choose a tool(sharing widget) and configure it from 'TOOLS' Dashboard.
Many widgets available (FREE and Paid), select the one (or more) according to your choice.
The one we use in LinuxBB.com is "Sharing Sidebar"

Copy the profile ID in to "AddThis settings in your "Home -> Board Settings -> AddThis -> AddThis Profile ID:"
Select Enable addthis: "Yes"
Save Settings.

You should be able to see sharing widgets immediately after this on all Forum pages.

What are the benefits of this plugin?
AddThis automates the Social sharing buttons according to the visitors choice!
Visitors are greeted with the sharing buttons they wanted always!
Webmaster can get World Class Analytics and detailed overview on what exactly is getting shared?
There will be no JavaScript loading delay since this plugin calls it asynchronously
No additional load to the forum (scripts or images)
Easy installation, no template edits
Anybody can opt out of this them self
