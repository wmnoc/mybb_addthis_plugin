Friends,
Would you like more visitors from social media?

Plugin Installation
Copy "addthis.php" to plugins directory.

Configuration
MyBB AddThis Plugin requires a "Profile ID" Go to AddThis.com, signup and create a profile and copy the profile ID.
Profile ID would be something like this: 'ra-99e3404b22a33456'.

After profile creation, Choose a tool(sharing widget) and configure it from 'TOOLS' Dashboard.
Many widgets available (FREE and Paid), select the one (or more) according to your choice.
The one we use in LinuxBB.com is "Sharing Sidebar"

Copy the profile ID in to "AddThis settings in your "Home -> Board Settings -> AddThis -> AddThis Profile ID:"
Select Enable addthis: "Yes"
Save Settings.

You should be able to see sharing widgets immediately after this on all Forum pages.

What are the benefits of this plugin?

Webmaster can get World Class Analytics and detailed overview on what exactly is getting shared?

Easy installation, no template edits
Anybody can opt out of this them self
